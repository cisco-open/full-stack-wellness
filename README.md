# Creating a team where everyone thrives

#WeAreCisco.  As an employee or contingent worker, you are probably familiar with this hashtag phrase.   Some of us have even included #WeAreCisco in our Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram feeds, or even in blog posts.   

As we reflect over the past 2 years during this pandemic, the “we” in #WeAreCisco have continued to innovate on how we work, live, play, and connect.  To connect means to “bring together or into contact so that a real or notional link is established.”  We now connect with each other on a global scale, through a plethora of ever-evolving technologies and platforms, more than any other period of human evolution.  However, we must not lose sight of one-to-one human connections as we engage with diverse teams and individuals.    

Under the leadership of our vice president, Grace Francisco, the Developer Relations organization has created a diversity council to pilot the “Full Stack Wellness and Inclusion Series” in the second half of FY22. The diversity council consists of engineers, project/program managers, developer advocates, and marketing leads. We saw a need to align more fully with  Cisco’s Inclusion and Collaboration mission “to truly connect to each other where we can collaborate at exciting new levels.”  Our vision is to “Create a community at work where everyone feels heard and included, where everyone can hear and include their colleagues.” Through this event series, we want to create a sense of “togetherness and inclusivity”- and embrace the diverse backgrounds amongst all team members. This initiative is fully supported by Grace and the entire DevRel Senior Leadership Team. 


## What will we talk about in the sessions?

In 1943, American psychologist Abraham Maslow theorized that there are five categories of human needs that dictate an individual’s behavior. He visualized those needs as a pyramid or triangle, with the most fundamental needs at the base.  The needs he identified are physiological needs, safety needs, love and belonging needs, esteem needs, and self-actualization needs. Maslow’s model is still a valid tool for understanding human motivation and personal development in 2022.

Taking Maslow’s theory as a guiding point, the diversity council has curated a series of sessions as part of “Full Stack Wellness and Inclusion Series.” Each session reflects on one level of Maslow’s pyramid from bottom to top.

The first session will focus on self-care: **“Your physical layer: - Healthy Mind, Healthy Body”**
The analogy of “Secure your own mask first before assisting others” is so apt when it comes to self-care. Our first session will focus on taking care of your physical and mental health first. We have invited Cisco wellbeing and mental health ambassadors to share their tips and insights on how we can take better care of ourselves in a hybrid work environment.

The second session will continue with: **“Designing a Team where everyone feels safe”**
This session will focus on creating a safer work environment. We will address topics such as microaggressions as they appear consciously or unconsciously, and how to identify them. We are inviting members from the Connected Black Professionals communities as guest speakers for this session.

The third session will explore: **“Developing a team where everyone belongs”**
With such a demographically diverse team, we need to understand each other’s boundaries, needs, and motivations. The session will highlight the value of proximity and a culture of belonging where we can express who we are. Cisco’s Back2Business community will be the guest speaker for this session.

The fourth session will continue with: **“Team Code Reviews: The art of giving and receiving support”**
Individuals with disability and Individuals who are caregivers for individuals with disability should not feel scared to share and talk about their struggles. This session highlights the importance of supporting each other and allowing others to support us. We will be joined by the Connected Disabilities Awareness Network (CDAN) to give more insights into Cisco’s initiatives in this area.

Our last session will look at the: **“CI/CD Pipeline for your Best self”**
The creativity of our employees is a key success factor for our organization. Also, when employees are in an environment where they can thrive, they are more likely to help others grow (which is also called the  multiplier effect). We will focus on the power of mentoring, proximity, and sponsorship with Emerging Talent @Cisco as the guest speaker for the session.

We strongly encourage you to be a part of these sessions and not skip any hierarchical step! Our hope is that you will join us for this event series as we build solid networks and relationships within the DevRel organization.
