## Slide 5 

Text to provide context of session: Once the first three needs i.e. Physiological, safety, and social needs are fulfilled, the esteem needs come into the picture. The need for a sense of personal value or esteem is derived from our desire for acceptance in society and social status. Here, people give priority and importance to gain respect, regard, accomplishments, etc. In fact, it doesn’t matter whether our social circle is small or big; we all seek approval and validation on certain matters or things from our surroundings or social circle. Different components are included in esteem needs, like gaining respect from others, confidence, individual accomplishments, belief in self, etc. Both internal (self) and external (society) acceptance are required to satisfy esteem needs. Esteem needs are categorized as lower and higher esteem needs in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs
