## Offline engagement

Use whichever chat/messaging program your organization prefers. Structure the layout in this way:

Top Level – DevRel Full Stack Wellness & Inclusion Series

Groups/Rooms/Channels:
* General – Announcements for the program and general asynchronous communication among the program team running this series
* Session specific – Create a separate place for the program team to coordinate logistics before, during, and after each session. For ex.
  * Session 1 – 
  * Session 2 – 
  * Session 3 – 
  * Session 4 – 
  * Session 5 – 


## Audience polling

Leverage your companies preferred tool for this purpose. For example:

* Smartsheet
* Microsoft Forms
* Kahoot
* Slido
* Quizizz

Use to capture input from attendees during each session for post-event reporting and KPI measurement.


## Post-event Check-in

Offer a check-in time for all attendees to join (optional) and talk about how they’ve used what was learned since the event. 

Schedule 2 of these (minimum) to cover different time zones so all team members have the opportunity to participate.
