Slide 2- Notes [We are super happy to have you here and welcome to our first session which is part of a wider FullStack Wellness & Inclusion Series! Today we will talk about your physical layer - which is - essentially keeping healthy body and healthy mind! ] 

Slide 3-   

As you can see in the agenda we have a few topics to cover during this session:​ 

​ 
​ 

Just to give you a little bit of a heads up we will give you some additional context around the concept of this series , then we will have a team member share his story about how he is keeping his body and mind healthy and how it helps him in his day to day live! ​ 

​ 
​ 

Then we will have our great guest speaker - part of our health & wellbeing team  

​ 

Then we will tell you a little bit more about our  Healthy Body, Healthy Mind Challenge.​ 

​ 

Following that we will have our live Q&A with Executive Sponsor 

 - please bear in mind that we want to keep this session as interactive as possible, so if you have any questions - please send them in the chat! We will monitor them and either answer via chat or will bring them up during our Q&A’s!​ 

 

Slide 4- Background on this session: we have mentioned that our Full Stack Wellness & Inclusion Series is based on the concept developed in 1943 by American psychologist - Abraham Maslow.  Even though this model has been developed many years ago - the key principles are still very relevant today. ​ 

​ 
​ 

The hierarchy of needs is split between deficiency needs and growth needs. (Up until esteem needs - these are deficiency needs and everything above are growth needs). When creating our series, we really wanted to show you, how crucial it is for each one of us to put yourself first. ​ 

​ 
​ 

Why? There is a lot of research out there that says How Trying to Make Everyone Happy Can Make You Miserable. And this is why we are here today - to remind you that before you will try to make the world a better place, you need take a look at yourself, and most importantly - take care of yourself.  Today’s session - hopefully - will give you some tools and knowledge to start thinking about these changes.  

 

 

 

 

Slide 6  

What do we mean when we talk about “The Whole You” – this is You at Your Best – at home and at work.  If we can all find ways to make small changes and focus on each of these areas of wellbeing in our lives, we will be stronger as individuals and as teams.​ 

 ​ 

Physical Wellbeing is not just about diet and exercise – it is the simplicity of moving throughout the day – getting out of our heads and into our body.  Focusing on our preventative health and self-care and really taking time out to rest and recharge on a regular basis – sleep and time off from work is so important for building resilience!​ 

 ​ 

Emotional Wellbeing – our focus on our mental health is just as important as our physical health.  We need to concentrate on ourselves in order to be there for those around us.  Don’t feel isolated and connect regularly with family, friends and perhaps a purpose you have in life.  Seek help when needed and be open, aware and inclusive with one another.​ 

 ​ 

Our Social Wellbeing is all about our connections.  It is how we bring Our Principles to life each day, sharing stories, celebrating moments and really getting to know each other and giving back to our communities.​ 

 ​ 

Financial Wellbeing is perhaps a new dimension to think about here, however such an important one.  Throughout our lives we have expected and unexpected things happening to us where we may have wished we had been more planful of our finances to alleviate unnecessary stress and pressure.  If we can be more aware and educate ourselves, we can address immediate needs and also plan for the future.  It is important to optimise our benefit options available to us as well and understand how they can help with this planning.​ 

 ​ 

Life can be pretty complicated though and each and every one of us will have something going on that others may not know. Through the power of The Four Elements – Eat, Sweat, Think and Connect we can focus on it’s simplicity to make some small, sustainable changes that help us all become more aware, resilient and able to deal with life’s ups and downs.

Manager Tips​ 

Role model healthy behaviours – tell your teams when you are taking time away from work​ 

Let people know what your personal boundaries are – time for movement, children, caring, giving back​ 

Use to share your well-being priority - ask your teams to do the same​ 

Take time for YOU – in order to be there for others at work and home you need to ensure you take time for your own well-being and resilience​ 

Rest and recharge – ensure you are taking regular breaks – particularly during the shutdown and let's make a commitment not to connect on work topics unless absolutely critical​ 

Show kindness and compassion – be authentic and understanding.  Many people will be dealing with a lot right now and they may not share – create a safe space for this​ 

Remember that different people, need different things at different times – understand this and be empathetic of others
